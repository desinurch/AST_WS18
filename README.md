# Advanced Software Technology - Project 2018

## Overview

Repository for doing lab works of AST

Team members:
1. Raina Thomas
2. Oumaima Tiati
3. Desiana Dien Nurchalifah

Initial Requirements:
1. Code language			: Java
2. Coding standard			: Eclipse
3. Testing framework		: JUnit
4. Data structure			: Array of objects
5. Input and output format	: Array of objects

the representation of our software : 

Our project consists in combining the results of different systems of identification of a set of objects by using different modalities passed through different algorithms.Our system of identification which consits of a number n of cameras identifies m objects to place on the table by specifying the probability, and later, our software will fornize the objects located with the most possible certainty by combining the objects with an identifier number choosing the highest probability


install our project : 
To install our project, just download the executable file (project.jar),then run the command "java -jar project.jar".
