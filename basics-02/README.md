# Welcome to Python/Java/Cpp! + Data Structures

## Overview

The primary goal of the first half is to ensure that your Python installation process went smoothly, and that there are no lingering Python installation bugs floating around.

The second half focuses more on using data structures to solve some interesting problems.

You're welcome to work in groups or individually. Remember to have some fun! Make friends and maybe relax a little too!

**Note: These labs are *designed* to be long! You shouldn't be able to finish all the problems in one class period. Work through as much as you can in the time allotted, but also feel free to skip from question to question freely. The extra problems are intended to be extra practice, if you want to hone your Python skills even more.**

Above all, have fun playing with Python/Java/Cpp! Enjoy.

## Warming Up

### Hello World

If you haven’t already, write a Hello World program which consists of getting Python to print `"Hello, World!"` to the console. First, write this program using the interactive interpreter. Next, put the body of the program into a file named `hello.py`, and run the Hello World program as a Python script.

### Conditionals

Get two integers from the user.

Then,   display a message if the first integer is:

* less than,
* equal to,   or
* greater than

the second integer.


1. Test the condition   for each case separately,   so that   all three comparison operators are used   in the code. 
2. Test the condition with switch case
3. Test the condition with the nesting conditional 

### Loop
Start an integer value at   **1024**.

Loop while it is greater than zero.

Print the value (with a newline) and divide it by two each time through the loop. 


### Printing

Write a program using `print()` that, when run, prints out a tic-tac-toe board.

```
  |  |
--------
  |  |
--------
  |  |  
```

*Hint: you may find the optional arguments to `print` useful. You can read about them [here](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/functions.html#print)*

### Printing #2 (challenge)

Write a program that, when run, prints out a SUPER tic-tac-toe board.

```
  |  |  H  |  |  H  |  |  
--+--+--H--+--+--H--+--+--
  |  |  H  |  |  H  |  |  
--+--+--H--+--+--H--+--+--
  |  |  H  |  |  H  |  |  
========+========+========
  |  |  H  |  |  H  |  |  
--+--+--H--+--+--H--+--+--
  |  |  H  |  |  H  |  |  
--+--+--H--+--+--H--+--+--
  |  |  H  |  |  H  |  |  
========+========+========
  |  |  H  |  |  H  |  |  
--+--+--H--+--+--H--+--+--
  |  |  H  |  |  H  |  |  
--+--+--H--+--+--H--+--+--
  |  |  H  |  |  H  |  |  
```

You'll find that there may be many ways to solve this problem. Which do you think is the most 'pythonic?' Talk to someone next to you about your approach to this problem. Remember the Zen of Python!

### Fizz, Buzz, FizzBuzz!
If we list all of the natural numbers under 41 that are a multiple of 3 or 5, we get

```
 3,  5,  6,  9, 10, 12, 15,
18, 20, 21, 24, 25, 27, 30,
33, 35, 36, 39, 40
```

The sum of these numbers is 408.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1001. As a sanity check, the last two digits of the sum should be `68`.

### Collatz Sequence

The *Collatz sequence* is an iterative sequence defined on the positive integers by:

```
n -> n / 2    if n is even
n -> 3n + 1   if n is odd
```

For example, using the rule above and starting with 13 yields the sequence:

```
13 -> 40 -> 20 -> 10 -> 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1
```

It can be seen that this sequence (starting at 13 and finishing at 1) contains 10 terms. Although unproven, it it hypothesized that all starting numbers finish at 1.

What is the length of the longest chain which has a starting number under 1000?

*NOTE: Once the chain starts the terms are allowed to go above one thousand.*

Challenge: Same question, but for any starting number under 1,000,000. What about for any starting number under 10,000,000? You may need to implement a cleverer-than-naive algorithm.

### Fahrenheit-to-Celsius converter
Write a program to convert degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Celcius by (1) asking the user for a number (not necessarily integral) representing the current temperature in degrees Fahrenheit, (2) converting that value into the equivalent degrees Celsius, and (3) printing the final equivalent value.

For example, your program should be able to emulate the following sample run:

```
Temperature F? 212
It is 100.0 degrees Celsius.

Temperature F? 98.6
It is 37.0 degrees Celsius.

Temperature F? 10
It is -12.222222222222221 degrees Celsius.
```

Want to be fancy (challenge)? Try to print the final temperature to two decimal places. For example, in the last case above we would print `-12.22` instead of `-12.222222222222221`. *Hint: Take a look at the [`round()`](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/functions.html#round) function. Isn't Python great?*


## Investigating Data Structures

*[Optional Reading on Standard Types - check out Sequence types and Mapping types](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/stdtypes.html)*

### Lists
Type the following lines at your Python interactive interpreter and see if they match what you expect:

```
s = [0] * 3
print(s)
s[0] += 1
print(s)

s = [''] * 3
print(s)
s[0] += 'a'
print(s)

s = [[]] * 3
print(s)
s[0] += [1]
print(s)
```

Why is this happening? Consider using the `id` function to investigate further. What happens when we replace the second-to-last line with `s[0] = s[0] + [1]`? What if we replace the line with `s[0].append(1)`?

### Tuples

Write a function to compute the [GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of two positive integers. You can freely use the fact that `gcd(a, b)` is mathematically equal to `gcd(b, a % b)`, and that `gcd(a, 0) == a`.

```
def gcd(a, b):
    pass  # Your implementation here
    
gcd(10, 25) # => 5
gcd(14, 15) # => 1
gcd(3, 9) # => 3
gcd(1, 1) # => 1
```

You can assume that `a >= b` if you'd like.

It is possible to accomplish this in three lines of Python code (fewer if you're really clever). Consider exploiting tuple packing and unpacking!

*Note: don't use the `gcd` in the standard library!*

### Dictionaries
In class, we saw a (naive) implementation of a dictionary comprehension that swaps the keys and values in a dictionary:

```
{value: key for key, value in dictionary.items()}
```

However, this approach will fail when there are two keys in the dictionary with the same value.

Write a function that properly reverses the keys and values of a dictionary - each key (originally a value) should map to a set of values (originally keys) that mapped to it. For example,

```
flip_dict({"CA": "US", "NY": "US", "ON": "CA"})
# => {"US": ["CA", "NY"], "CA": ["ON"]}
```

Note: there is a data structure in the `collections` module from the standard library called `defaultdict` which provides exactly this sort of functionality. You provide it a factory method for creating default values in the dictionary (in this case, a list.) You can read more about `defaultdict` and other `collections` data structures [here](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/collections.html).

### Comprehensions

*Read*

Predict the output of each of the following list comprehensions. After you have written down your hypothesis, run the code in an interactive interpreter to see if you were correct. If you were incorrect, discuss with a partner why Python returns what it does.

```
[x for x in [1, 2, 3, 4]]
[n - 2 for n in range(10)]
[k % 10 for k in range(41) if k % 3 == 0]
[s.lower() for s in ['PythOn', 'iS', 'cOoL'] if s[0] < s[-1]]

# Something is fishy here. Can you spot it?
arr = [[3,2,1], ['a','b','c'], [('do',), ['re'], 'mi']]
print([el.append(el[0] * 4) for el in arr])  # What is printed?
print(arr)  # What is the content of `arr` at this point?


[letter for letter in "pYthON" if letter.isupper()]
{len(w) for w in ["its", "the", "remix", "to", "ignition"]}
```

*Write*

Write a comprehension to transform the input data structure into the output data structure

```
[0, 1, 2, 3] -> [1, 3, 5, 7]  # Double and add one
['apple', 'orange', 'pear'] -> ['A', 'O', 'P']  # Capitalize first letter
['apple', 'orange', 'pear'] -> ['apple', 'pear']  # Contains a 'p'

["TA_sam", "student_poohbear", "TA_guido", "student_htiek"] -> ["sam", "guido"]
['apple', 'orange', 'pear'] -> [('apple', 5), ('orange', 6), ('pear', 4)]

['apple', 'orange', 'pear'] -> {'apple': 5, 'orange': 6, 'pear': 4}
```

### Pascal's Triangle
Write a function that generates the next level of Pascal's triangle given a list that represents a valid row of Pascal’s triangle.

```
generate_pascal_row([1, 2, 1]) -> [1, 3, 3, 1]
generate_pascal_row([1, 4, 6, 4, 1]) -> [1, 5, 10, 10, 5, 1]
generate_pascal_row([]) -> [1]
```

As a reminder, each element in a row of Pascal's triangle is formed by summing the two elements in the previous row directly above (to the left and right) that elements. If there is only one element directly above, we only add that one. For example, the first 5 rows of Pascal's triangle look like:

```
    1
   1 1
  1 2 1
 1 3 3 1
1 4 6 4 1
```

You may find the `zip` function discussed briefly in lecture useful, along with some cleverness. Alternatively, you could solve this problem with `enumerate`. Avoid using a loop of the form `for i in len(range(row)):`.

*Hint: Check out the diagram below. How could you use this insight to help complete this problem?*

```
  0 1 3 3 1
+ 1 3 3 1 0
-----------
  1 4 6 4 1
``` 

### Triad Phrases

Triad words are English words for which the two smaller strings you make by extracting alternating letters both form valid words.

For example:

![Triad Phrases](http://i.imgur.com/jGEXJWi.png)

Write a function to determine whether an entire phrase passed into a function is made of triad words. You can assume that all words are made of only alphabetic characters, and are separated by whitespace. We will consider the empty string to be an invalid English word.

```
is_triad_phrase("learned theorem") # => True
is_triad_phrase("studied theories") # => False
is_triad_phrase("wooded agrarians") # => True
is_triad_phrase("forrested farmers") # => False
is_triad_phrase("schooled oriole") # => True
is_triad_phrase("educated small bird") # => False
is_triad_phrase("a") # => False
is_triad_phrase("") # => False
```

What would be an appropriate data structure in which to store the English words?

Using either `/usr/share/dict/words` or `http://stanfordpython.com/res/misc/words`, a 2.5M text file containing over 200 thousand English words, which are triad words? As a sanity check, we found 2770 distinct triad words (case-insensitive).

### Surpassing Phrases (challenge)

Surpassing words are English words for which the gap between each adjacent pair of letters strictly increases. These gaps are computed without "wrapping around" from Z to A.

For example:

![Surpassing Phrases](http://i.imgur.com/XKiCnUc.png)

Write a function to determine whether an entire phrase passed into a function is made of surpassing words. You can assume that all words are made of only alphabetic characters, and are separated by whitespace. We will consider the empty string and a 1-character string to be valid surpassing phrases.

```
is_surpassing_phrase("superb subway") # => True
is_surpassing_phrase("excellent train") # => False
is_surpassing_phrase("porky hogs") # => True
is_surpassing_phrase("plump pigs") # => False
is_surpassing_phrase("turnip fields") # => True
is_surpassing_phrase("root vegetable lands") # => False
is_surpassing_phrase("a") # => True
is_surpassing_phrase("") # => True
```

You may find the Python functions `ord` (one-character string to integer ordinal) and `chr` (integer ordinal to one-character string) useful to solve this puzzle.

```
ord('a') # => 97
chr(97) # => 'a'
```

Using either `/usr/share/dict/words` or `http://stanfordpython.com/res/misc/words`, which are surpassing words? As a sanity check, we found 1931 distinct surpassing words.


### Cyclone Phrases (challenge)

Cyclone words are English words that have a sequence of characters in alphabetical order when following a cyclic pattern. 

For example:

![Cyclone Phrases](http://i.stack.imgur.com/4XBV3.png)

Write a function that to determine whether an entire phrase passed into a function is made of cyclone words. You can assume that all words are made of only alphabetic characters, and are separated by whitespace.

```
is_cyclone_phrase("adjourned") # => True
is_cyclone_phrase("settled") # => False
is_cyclone_phrase("all alone at noon") # => True
is_cyclone_phrase("by myself at twelve pm") # => False
is_cyclone_phrase("acb") # => True
is_cyclone_phrase("") # => True
```

Using either `/usr/share/dict/words` or `http://stanfordpython.com/res/misc/words`, which are cyclone words? As a sanity check, we found 769 distinct cyclone words.

### Other Phrases (challenge)

On Puzzling.StackExchange, the user [JLee](https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/463/jlee) has come up with a ton of interesting puzzles of this form ("I call words that follow a certain rule "adjective" words"). If you like puzzles, optionally read through [these JLee puzzles](https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/search?q=%22I+call+it%22+title%3A%22what+is%22+is%3Aquestion+user%3A463) or [these other puzzles inspired by JLee](https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/search?tab=votes&q=%22what%20is%20a%22%20word%20is%3aquestion).

### Triangle Numbers
The nth term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by 1 + 2 + ... + n = n(n+1) / 2. For example, the first ten triangle numbers are: `1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...`

By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its alphabetical position (`A=1`, `B=2`, etc) and adding these values we form a word value. For example, the word value for SKY is `19 + 11 + 25 = 55` and 55 is a triangle number. If the word value is a triangle number then we shall call the word a triangle word.

Using either `/usr/share/dict/words` or `http://stanfordpython.com/res/misc/words`, which are triangle words? As a sanity check, we found 16303 distinct triangle words.

*Hint: you can use `ord(ch)` to get the integer ASCII value of a character*

## Bonus Problems

*Only attempt to solve these bonus problems if you've finished the rest of the lab. Bonus problems are intentionally much harder than the other lab problems.*

### Polygon Collision

Given two polygons in the form of lists of 2-tuples, determine whether the two polygons intersect.

```
def polygon_collision(poly1, poly2):
    pass
```

Formally, a polygon is represented by a list of (x, y) tuples, where each (x, y) tuple is a vertex of the polygon. Edges are assumed to be between adjacent vertices in the list, and the last vertex is connected to the first. For example, the unit square would be represented by

```
square = [(0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (1,0)]
```

You can assume that the polygon described by the provided list of tuples is not self-intersecting, but do not assume that it is convex.

**Note: this is a *hard* problem. Quite hard.**
