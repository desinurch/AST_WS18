# Credible code

This week we move away from requirements develpment to other important skills which are required to make sure the code
we develop is of the out most credibility.

There are some tools available online which helps us in acheving this. 

1. Status of documentation
2. Status of test cases https://github.com/marketplace/category/continuous-integration
3. Status of test coverage https://github.com/marketplace/category/continuous-integration
4. Status of code quality https://github.com/marketplace/category/code-quality
5. etc etc

These status can be added to your github project README file as badges.
